If you are told to self-iso­late, you will need to stay at home and avoid con­tact with oth­ers for 14 days. Try not to stay in the same room with oth­ers at the same time, the U.K.’s Na­tional Health Ser­vice rec­om­mends. Stay in a well-ven­ti­lated room with a win­dow that can be opened. Don’t share tow­els, uten­sils or dishes with oth­ers, and wash them thor­oughly af­ter use. Clean bath­rooms and sur­faces reg­u­larly. Wash your hands be­fore and af­ter con­tact with pets.
